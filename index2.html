            find
            out what e-sports is in more detail on any information site on the Internet. <br>
            Ukrainian players took part in dozens of small competitions. And in 2001, the Samsung company decided to

            the World Cyber ​​Games selection in Ukraine. Selection rounds were held all over the country. A paid trip
            abroad, competitions with foreigners and a huge prize fund of hundreds of thousands of dollars awaited the
            winners. <br>
            After the World Cyber ​​Games, other major championships began to appear in Ukraine. For example, ASUS Open

            In 2019, the revenues of the eSports industry were estimated at $950 million, and the audience was estimated
            at
            445 million people. Of these, 245 million were casual viewers, but 200 were eSports enthusiasts, the UPEA
            president said. These categories will increase significantly in a few years — up to 350 million and 295
            million,
            respectively, by the end of 2023. At the same time, revenues will grow to $1.56 billion. <br>

            transformation of
            society, Oleksandr Kokhanovsky emphasized. <br>
            In addition, eSports is a huge opportunity to socialize a lot of people. For example, those who suffer from
            post-traumatic syndrome, because "we are in a warring country", said Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers
            Oleg
            Nemchinov. <br>

            countries in e-sports. <br>
            In the countries, where e-sports segment is the most developed, wines penetrate into the most popular
            schools and institutions.
            For example, in Denmark, eSports has already been upgraded to some high school programs.
