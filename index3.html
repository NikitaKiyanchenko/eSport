            Dota 2 is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game by Valve.
            The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA),
            a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in
            matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on
            the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have
            unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items
            for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team
            wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient",
            a large structure located within their base. <br> <br>
